# Setup

## New MicroK8s project (macOS)

1. Brew is used to install the software on your machine, but is not part of the script. If Brew is not installed, then run
	- /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
 
2. To Install & configure your microk8s cluser, go to from your home folder (ex. cd ~), then run
	- `curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tr3kl0v/microk8s-setup-for-osx/master/lib/install | bash`
